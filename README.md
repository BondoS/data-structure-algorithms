### Implementation of most famous Data Structures using JavaScript

1. Stacks <br />
   A stack is a LIFO “last-in-first-out” data structure which means that the newest element (the element which was added last) in the stack will be the first one removed.

1. Queues <br />
   Queues are very similar to stacks however they use the FIFO “first-in-first- out” paradigm. Which means that the oldest element (the element that was added first) is the next item to be removed.
