### Implementation of most famous Data Structures using JavaScript

1. Stacks <br />
   A stack is a LIFO “last-in-first-out” data structure which means that the newest element (the element which was added last) in the stack will be the first one removed.

2. Queues <br />
   Queues are very similar to stacks however they use the FIFO “first-in-first- out” paradigm. Which means that the oldest element (the element that was added first) is the next item to be removed.

3. Linked Lists <br />
   Linked lists are a series of linked nodes where each node points to the next node in the list. Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node. There are also doubly-linked lists in which each node also points to the previous node in the list.

   Linked lists use the LIFO“last-in-first-out” method (similar to a stack) where nodes are added to and deleted from the same end.

4. Graphs <br />
   A graph is a data structure composed of a collection of nodes and edges. Graphs are a non-linear data structure (as opposed to a linked list, stack, or queue). You may also hear nodes referred to as vertices.

5. Trees <br />
   A tree is a data structure where a node can have zero or more children. Each node contains a value, and similar to graphs each node can have a connection between other nodes called an edge. A tree is a type of graph but not all graphs are trees.
   In this repo we will demonstrate Binary search trees.
